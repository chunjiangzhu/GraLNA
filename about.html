                <p>Old Dominion University (ODU) is a public research university in Norfolk, Virginia, United States. Established in 1930 as the two-year Norfolk Division of the College of William & Mary, the school became an independent college in 1962 and attained university status in 1969. In 2023, it had an enrollment of 23,494 students, and its main campus covers 250 acres.<br>

The university's name is derived from one of Virginia's state nicknames, "The Old Dominion", given by King Charles II of England in recognition of its loyalty to the crown during the English Civil War. ODU offers 175 undergraduate and graduate degree programs from seven colleges and three schools. It has a Carnegie Classification of "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity" with "Higher Access, Medium Earnings". Old Dominion has approximately 165,000 alumni in all 50 states and 67 countries.</p>

                <h3 class="meta">About Department of Computer Science</h3>
